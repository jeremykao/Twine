			<a class="legalheadings" id="privacy"><h1>Privacy Policy</h1></a>
			<p>This Privacy Policy discloses the privacy practices for Twine, and governs your use of our website, twine.rs (hereafter, “website” or “site”).</p>
			<p>Twine, the provider of the site (referred to as “us” or “we”), is committed to protecting your privacy online. You acknowledge that this Privacy Policy is part of our Site Terms of Use, and by accessing or using our site, you agree to be bound by all of its terms and conditions. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not access or use this site.</p>
			<p>We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. Such changes, modifications, additions or deletions shall be effective immediately upon providing notice, which includes but is not limited to posting the revised Policy on this page. You acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to review this Policy periodically and to make yourself aware of any changes/modifications. Your continued use of the site after such modifications, regardless of whether you have actual notice of the changes/modifications, will constitute your: (a) acknowledgment of the modified Policy; and (b) agreement to abide and be bound by the modified Policy.</p>
			<h3>Collecting Information</h3>
			<p>Like most website operators, Twine collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Twine’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Twine’s visitors use its website.</p>
			<p>Twine also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. </p>
			<p>When you engage in certain activities on this site, such as using our site, we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself, or we may pull such information from a particular website to which you provided that information. It is completely optional for you to engage in using our services, but if you elect to use our services, you authorize us to obtain and use any and all information you have provided directly to us, as well as any and all information you have provided to those third party websites and that is available to us through employment of an Application Programming Interface (“API”) or other mechanism. Such information we collect from third parties via an API or similar mechanism includes but is not limited to: your name, email, user id, address, profile picture, interests, likes, security settings, location, and users’ contents (for example, on Facebook, friends, likes, etc.).</p>
			<h3>Use of Information</h3>
			<p>We do not collect any Personally Identifiable Information about you unless you voluntarily provide it to us. For example, you provide certain Personally Identifiable Information to us when you: (a) register for our services, use our services; (b) send email messages, submit online forms, or transmit other information. We may also collect information from you at other points on our site.</p>
			<p>We will primarily use your Personally Identifiable Information to provide our services to you, as required by our agreements with you. We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our agreements with you, including our Site Terms of Use and this Private Policy.</p>
			<h3>Cookies</h3>
			<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Twine uses cookies to help Twine identify and track visitors, their usage of Twine website, and their website access preferences. Twine visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Twine’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Twine’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
			<h3>Release of Information</h3>
			<p>We do not sell, trade, or rent your Personally Identifiable Information to others. We may use your Personally Identifiable Information to operate our site and deliver our services.</p>
			<p>Occasionally we may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide Personally Identifiable Information to the appropriate governmental authorities. We will disclose Personally Identifiable Information upon receipt of a court order, subpoena, or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation. We fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our services for illegal activities. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful.</p>
			<h3>Security of Information</h3>
			<p>Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your Personally Identifiable Information, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control; (b) the security, integrity and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through this site cannot be guaranteed; and (c) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party.</p>
			<h3>Privacy Policies of Third Party Sites</h3>
			<p>Except as otherwise discussed in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. Other sites accessible through our site have their own privacy policies and data collection, use, and disclosure practices. Please consult each site’s privacy policy. We are not responsible for the policies or practices of third parties.</p>
